# osales dataset

# OSALES
# This is a pre-processed version of the dataset used in Kaggle’s “Online Product Sales” competition (Kaggle 2012) that concerns the prediction of the online sales of consumer products.
# Each row in the dataset corresponds to a different product that is described by various prod123

# uct features as well as features of an advertising campaign. There are 12 target variables
# corresponding to the monthly sales for the first 12 months after the product launches. For the
# purposes of this study we removed examples with missing values in any target variable (112
