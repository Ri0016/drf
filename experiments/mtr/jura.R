# andro dataset

# ANDRO
# The Andromeda dataset (Hatzikos et al. 2008) concerns the prediction of future values for
# six water quality variables (temperature, pH, conductivity, salinity, oxygen, turbidity) in
# Thermaikos Gulf of Thessaloniki, Greece. Measurements of the target variables are taken
# from under-water sensors with a sampling interval of 9 seconds and then averaged to get a
# single measurement for each variable over each day. The specific dataset that we use here
# corresponds to using a window of 5 days (i.e. features attributes correspond to the values of
# the six water quality variables up to 5 days in the past) and a lead of 5 days (i.e. we predict
